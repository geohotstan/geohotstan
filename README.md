*[Chorus]*  
My tea’s gone cold, I’m wondering why I  
Started coding at all  
The error logs cloud up my terminal (Terminal)  
And I can’t debug at all  
And even if I could, it’d all be bugs  
But your GitHub on my screen  
It reminds me that it’s not so bad, it’s not so bad (Bad)  

*[Verse]*  
Dear George, I wrote you, but you still ain’t respondin’  
I left my GitHub, my Discord, and my email at the bottom  
I sent two DMs back in autumn, you must not’ve got ‘em  
There prob’ly was a glitch on X or somethin’ with the modem  
Sometimes I type usernames too sloppy when I drop ‘em  
But anyways, screw it, what’s been up, man? How’s your comma?  
I just started coding too, I’m tryin’ to learn Python  
If I build an AI, guess what I’ma call it? I’ma name it Tiny  
I read about your Tesla hack too, that’s crazy  
I had a friend brick his car tryin’ to jailbreak the system  
I know you prob’ly hear this every day, but I’m your biggest fan  
I even got the early stuff you did with the iphone ban  
I got a room full of your repos and your write-ups, man  
I like the work you did with Tinygrad too, that shit was grand  
Anyways, I hope you see this, man, hit me back  
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan, this is Stan
