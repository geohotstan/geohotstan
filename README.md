Dear Geohot, I wrote you, but you still ain't callin'  
I left my cell, my pager and my home phone, all stallin'  
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not've got 'em  
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'  
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em  

But anyways, forget it, what's been up man, how's the coding?  
Your genius mind and skills, the world has been exploding  
My mind's blown, amazed by the things you've achieved  
You hacked the systems, showing what's possible to conceive  

I heard you took on Sony, challenging their dominion  
Risking it all, fighting for digital freedom's opinion  
I admire your audacity, your unwavering dedication  
You've become a symbol, a legend of the hacker nation  

I know you probably hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan  
I've followed your journey, every move, every plan  
I've got a room full of your exploits, your code and your frame  
Your name resonates in the hacker's hall of fame  

Geohot, your impact reaches far and wide  
Your work with PlayStation, unlocking new tides  
I hope you know the inspiration you've ignited  
In hackers and enthusiasts, your name is recited  

Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back  
Just to chat, to connect, it's a fan's humble ask  
Waiting eagerly for your next breakthrough, your next grand plan  
Truly yours, your biggest fan, this is Stan
